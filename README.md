Iâ€™m @Paganoss ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I don't know much about coding and developing but I'm trying to learn something ðŸ‘€ <br>
I know nothing about scripts and compilers but I already learned a bit of developing concept thanks to scratch. <br>
Scratch just gave me the basics, NOW I NEED MORE XD <br>
I really like retro art and indie games... <br>
I've done some pixel art too <br>
Btw I'm just a little guy, I'm just exploring :)
